Junior Design Competition Beacons
===============

This repository contains a collection of hardware and software used for the Binghamton University Junior Design Competition-- the centerpiece for a junior-level design course in the EECE department of Binghamton University. The repository can be considered a work in progess, though many components of the game are complete and tested.

##Game

The basics of the game-- and the gameplay rules-- will be described here once the challenge has been formally announced.


##Contents:

* _board software_: The low-level embedded software that drives the Beacon gameplay elements. This software should be programmed to the ATMega32U4 on the beacon PCB.
* _enclosure hardware_: A set of technical drawings which show how to create a Beacon, the core element of the gameplay field.  The vector images for these technical drawins can be lasercut to create an actual beacon enclosure ("beacon tower").
* _pc software_: A collection of PC software designed to drive the competition. This collection contains a set of utilities with which to test a student robot; and will contain the final software used to run the robotics competition.
* _pcb hardware_: The schematics, bill of materials, and PCB layout for the core PCB that drives each beacon element. These can be used to create a the core beacon element.
