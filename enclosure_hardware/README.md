Beacon "Tower" Enclosure for JD Beacon Boards
===============================================

The SVG files included in this folder are a layout template for the JD Beacon Tower, which is a full stand-up enclosure for the Junior Design Beacon gameplay elements. These designs are intended to be "2D" lasercut from a sheet pf sturdy material, such as an acrylic or delran; and then snap together to form a full gameplay element.

* These designs are not yet proven as of 12/04, but will be fabricated shortly-- and updated or marked "proven" by the end of next week.
* These designs were created in Inkscape-- the recommended tool for editing them.
* You may wish to change the "387" emblazened on the side to your own logo. (EECE 387 is the course number for Junior Design at binghamton university).
